# College Helper

This project provides an interactive college admission predictor built with React and Vite. It allows students to input their academic profile and get admission predictions for various schools. College statistics are fetched from Google's Gemini API when an API key is provided.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file with your `GEMINI_API_KEY` to enable live college data fetching.
